# E-commerce for ceramic studio

Fullstack e-commerce website that was created as part of a coding bootcamp, with no design provided. 

I used my own ceramic studio branding, photos and product descriptions.

In this project, I focused on designing an attractive and intuitive UI that reflects the online shopping experience in real-world online shops. I created a visually appealing design that is easy to use and accessible across various devices. By understanding user needs and applying industry best practices, I ensured a pleasant UX through clear layout and consistent navigation. My goal was to create an interface that makes using the website easy and enjoyable for every user. 

The backend is a simple REST API, offering endpoints for products and orders, and is built using NestJS and MySQL.
